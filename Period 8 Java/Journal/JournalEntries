Creating Obstruction interface later to be used to identify objects that are obstructions that

Considering making a class for each wall image, and each floor image like wall1, wall2, wall3... etc. 
Getting ready to attempt display of wall/placing in 2d array and displaying.

* Goal for Monday: Complete testing of displaying single wall.

the wall or attempt that yet, as the screen isn't popping up.

5/11
- Finished displaying wall, grass, and scaling. Completed the sizing of screen so that a 9x9 display of
"blocks" can be shown at any given time. Worked with ViewObjects to add and display a field. Discussed 
work with Viewables so that I can change the grid of tiles being displayed.

5/15
- Laid out map 1's walls worked on displaying a 7x7 of the map. Couldn't get it to run because of a null 
value that was ? supposedly ? avoided due to my if statement. Going to do more work on it to get the map
section displayed

*Goal for Tuesday: display a 7x7 of the map.

5/16
- DISPLAYED A 7X7!!!!!!!!!!! CAN DISPLAY ANY 7X7!!! Fixed the last error, but a new one popped up. One that
doesn't interfere with the launching, but will look further into the new error. 

*Goal for Wednesday: Fix the error, and begin to make a non-hard coded version of the viewing 7x7

5/17
- Error fixed; Begun work with KeyListeners. Encountered problems with code;(KeyListeners need to reference
a player index/the map layout, but as superclass it can't access the information of the subclass? Theory
issues going to look deeper into it next class)

*Goal for Monday: Get Keylisteners to change character coordinates
